Master for investigations- best hospitals:

A few assumptions, since the accompanying information from HHS is not detailed: we assume that the “score” columns in the effective_care and readmissions tables relate to how well a hospital performs each procedure or combats each potential cause of readmission/mortality. For example, a hospital that scored high in all its effective_care columns means it provided good care for a range of procedures, and a hostile that scored high in all of its readmissions columns means that it successfully prevented or minimized all potential causes of mortality/readmissions. 

The eff_care_table has a score for each hospital and each procedure. This query takes the average the procedures for each hospital, and then gives the hospitals with the top 10 average total scores. If the data were high-quality, we would expect this query to answer the question of which hospitals provide the best care across a range of procedures. However, we must add a step, because many hospitals are missing data for many procedures. For example, there are many hospitals, clustered in PR, that have a very high score for only one procedure and null data for many others, so their average score is artificially very high. We want to exclude them, so we use the table eff_care_1, which filters out the null data, and search hospitals where there are a minimum number of procedures listed to ensure we are getting a measurement across a wide range of procedures. I picked 10 here, somewhat arbitrarily, but this seems to take care of much of this issue.

The discussed query: 
select provider_id,  hospital_name, count(provider_id), state, avg(score) as
score, sum(score), variance(score)
from eff_care_1
where score IS NOT NULL
group by provider_id, hospital_name, state
having count(provider_id)>10
order by score DESC
limit 10
;

Note that all hospitals selected as the top 10 in the us are evaluated on at least 12/17 possible procedures, indicating we are truly getting a cross section across a range of procedures. We have a concentration of hospitals in CA, NY and GA, which is interesting but not necessarily unexpected. Our average scores range from 187.7-144.3, which is a reasonable range and supports that our scores are reasonable. 

To pressure test these answers, let us try a similar procedure with the readmissions/mortality data. The hypothesis is that the readmissions/mortality data is a proxy for effective care- if effective care is provided, a hospital will score similarly high on its prevention of readmissions and mortality. We use a similarly structured query: 

select provider_id,  hospital_name, count(provider_id), state, avg(score) as
score, sum(score), variance(score)
from reads_1
where score IS NOT NULL
group by provider_id, hospital_name, state
having count(provider_id)>10
order by score DESC
limit 10
;

Unfortunately, none of these hospitals are repeated from the best hospitals analysis of the effective care data. However, the data all make sense, we have a tight range of average scores, from 19.2-17.5, a range of hospitals including some from NY, CA and GA, and all have scores averaged from across at least 14 procedures.

While either analysis would make sense, the first one more accurately answers the question of which hospitals provide the best care across a range of procedures, and the second answers which hospitals see the best results. Clearly one is not a perfect proxy for the other. It is also important to consider the quality of the data- many hospitals do not have scores for all procedures or measures of readmission, and many hospitals were excluded from this analysis because of the flawed and incomplete data.
